# Release process

## Manual

1. Make sure your repo is clean by git's standards
2. If this is a new minor release, create a new release branch and push to github, otherwise switch to it, for example `release-0.2`
3. Tag the repository and push the tag `git tag -s -m $VERSION $VERSION`
4. Set an environment variable PREVIOUS_VERSION to the last release tag.
5. Checkout the tag you've just created and make sure git is in a clean state
6. Run `make release`
7. Run `make create-gh-release` to create a draft release on Github, copying the generated release notes from out/CHANGELOG.md into the draft.
8. Run `make upload-gh-artifacts` to upload artifacts, however you may run into API limit errors, so verify artifacts at next step
9. Attach the files to the drafted release:
    1. `./out/clusterawsadm-darwin-amd64`
    2. `./out/clusterawsadm-linux-amd64`
    3. `./out/infrastructure-components.yaml`
    4. `./out/cluster-template.yaml`
    5. `./out/cluster-template-machinepool.yaml`
    6. `./out/cluster-template-eks.yaml`
    7. `./out/cluster-template-eks-managedmachinepool.yaml`
    8. `./out/cluster-template-eks-managedmachinepool-vpccni.yaml`
10. Perform the [image promotion process](https://github.com/kubernetes/k8s.io/tree/master/k8s.gcr.io#image-promoter).
    The staging repository is at https://console.cloud.google.com/gcr/images/k8s-staging-cluster-api-aws/GLOBAL. Be
    sure to choose the top level `cluster-api-aws-controller`, which will provide the multi-arch manifest, rather than one for a specific architecture.
11.  Finalise the release notes
12.  Publish release. Use the pre-release option for release
    candidate versions of Cluster API Provider AWS.
13.  Email `kubernetes-sig-cluster-lifecycle@googlegroups.com` to announce the release
